# ServerPlugin
a plugin i made for my private server that i decided to make public

## (Deprecated)
this plugin code is not the code that i currently run on my servers, and is missing a lot of functionality that i have implemented since it's last commit. also, the anti-suffocate anticheat is quite unstable, and can be exploited/can flag false positives or potentially delete block, so it's use is not recommended.
